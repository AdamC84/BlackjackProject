### Lessons learned
I think i finally had the light bulb come on when programming an object oriented program. I realized that you can create different objects in different classes. Two different classes can utilize one class that has one List<> in it, and use that list completely separate from each other. I need to start getting use to utilizing the separate classes methods that will get me values for certain things, instead of creating variables and doing arithmetic with those variables to get the same outcome that the method would have gotten me.
